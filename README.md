# knowledge-graph
sample code that demonstrates how you can build a topology ontology using the SSN ontology and the Bricks ontology in a Jupyter notebook. This code will generate a Turtle file that represents HVAC components including AHUs, chillers, heaters, coils, fans, temperature sensors, humidity sensors, pressure sensors, and airflow sensors, as well as the relationships between these components and the rooms in a building.

To use this code, you will need to install the rdflib and ontospy Python libraries.
